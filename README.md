## Intro

The Sorting Algorithm Race is a sorting race between the three algorithms; merge sort, quick sort, and gold's pore sort.

**Quick Sort**, the fastest of the 3, has a time complexity of **O(Log N)**, but is very unpredictable and complex.

**Merge Sort**, the second fastest, has a time complexity of **O(N Log N)** and has a very predictable *S* pattern that you can see in the visualization.

**Gold's Pore Sort**, the slowest of the 3, has a time complexity of **O(N^2)**, but is very likable and easy to implement in parallel computating.
